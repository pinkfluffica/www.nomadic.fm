                            <p>Ethics learning is increasingly assuming a central position within MBA, professional, and undergraduate programs. Yet students often express cynicism and “ethics fatigue” regarding the approaches taken by legacy teaching materials—approaches often defined by business ethics “horror stories” or high-minded rhetoric that doesn’t feel connected enough to daily reality. How, then, do we shape future organizations where values are not just talked about but acted upon, even when those actions are difficult? How can educational institutions effectively prepare students to meet rapidly evolving values challenges? </p>
                            <p>The key is to create learning that is less about analysis and more about action, less about “thou shalt not” and more about what empowered individuals “can do” when they are equipped to voice their values.</p>
                            <p>These are the issues that have guided the work of Mary Gentile and her collaborators for almost a decade. Her Giving Voice to Values (GVV) curriculum—now employed by hundreds of global universities and leading firms—prepares current and future leaders to voice their values, especially when it’s hard. It’s a values education rooted in self-awareness, tools for rehearsal and pre-scripting based on extensive research insights, and the practical realities of organizational life. </p>
                            <p>The GVV team has teamed up with Nomadic Learning to create a groundbreaking digital extension of their curriculum. Students navigate a series of practical case studies, original animations by renowned New Yorker and New York Times illustrator Jing Wei, Hollywood film clips, and social polls and debates while working together and with their instructors to determine how to voice values with more confidence and increased effectiveness. </p>
                            <p>GVV leverages the valuable time of instructors and students by enriching the classroom learning experience and providing a supportive learning framework. Students come to class having already engaged in deep learning and rich social debates. Instructors draw upon a range of student comments to help them plan for class and lead engaging discussions.  </p>
                            <p>GVV can either supplement or replace conventional ethics textbooks and learning materials within live or online class settings. GVV can be delivered over an entire semester or can work as a concentrated learning experience over a shorter period of time.   Nomadic’s GVV program is built around six Field Manuals, or learning modules, designed to help learners voice their values effectively:</p>

Nomadic Field Manuals are built from the ground up to maximize social interaction, starting with activities like polls and simple social challenges and culminating in rich debates. </p>
                                                        <h6>4. Competition</h6>

Competition spurs engagement without undermining the collaborative learning experience.</p>
                                                        <h6>5. Analytics</h6>
                                                        <p>Nomadic creates new data streams that allow instructors, administrators and students themselves to measure progress across dimensions like peer influence and intensity of engagement, in addition to standard measures of retention and understanding. Instructors can access real-time reports about the progress of students and the effectiveness of the program that are easy to interpret and simple to act upon. Analytics help tie learning more closely to the overall pedagogical goals of a particular class.</p>

Data from multiple cohorts can be combined to give an overall picture of engagement in the program by all participants, and different cohorts can be compared to highlight group differences in engagement, understanding, and influence.</p>
                                                        <p>Clients can access real-time reports about the progress of learners and the effectiveness of the program that are easy to interpret and simple to share.
