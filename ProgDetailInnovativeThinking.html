                                <p class="">Innovation has rapidly transformed into a cornerstone of academic business education. Individual instructors and entire institutions increasingly strive to equip students to lead innovative organizations. </p>
                                <p class="">But available learning texts — whether on or offline — have largely failed to keep pace with evolving understandings of innovation as both a mindset and a collaborative process. Can instructional texts and materials effectively support instructors in their attempts to instill innovation as a foundational leadership competency? </p>
                                <p class="">Not in the way we’ve thought about instructional texts for the past few decades. Innovation cannot be transferred from a teacher or a computer application directly into someone’s brain. But innovative thinking can be practiced. It can be experienced. It can be improved. Even in a classroom setting. </p>
                                <p class="">Nomadic’s Innovative Thinking is a pioneering digital learning program rooted in the realities of contemporary social, economic, and management trends. Students navigate a series of practical case studies, original animations, Hollywood film clips, and social polls and debates while working together and/or with their instructors to sharpen their thinking about innovation and hone their innovative capacities. </p>
                                <p>The result is a digital learning experience unlike any other. Learners emerge as stronger innovators and more confident leaders, equipped with peer-tested ideas to tackle the innovation challenges they will inevitably face during their careers.</p>
                                <p>Innovative Thinking leverages the valuable time of instructors and students by enriching the classroom learning experience and providing a supportive learning framework. Students come to class having already engaged in deep learning and rich social debates. Instructors draw upon a range of student comments to help them plan for class and lead engaging discussions. </p>
                                <p>Innovative Thinking can either supplement or replace conventional innovation textbooks and learning materials within live or online class settings. Innovative Thinking can be delivered over an entire semester or can work as a concentrated learning experience over a shorter period of time. </p>

                                                        <h6>1.   Embracing Uncertainty</h6>
                                                        <p>All innovation is uncomfortable. If we already know the answer or can easily find someone who does, we don’t really need to innovate. Innovative thinkers seek out ambiguity. They don’t jump too quickly to easy answers. They are comfortable being wrong.</p>
                                                        <h6>2.   Framing Problems</h6>
                                                        <p>The answer to every problem is inherent in the way we pose it. If we have framed the problem incorrectly, we have no chance of solving it. Innovative thinkers learn both how to re-imagine a problem and how to move their organizations to adopt the new frame.</p>
                                                        <h6>3.   Designing Experiments</h6>
                                                        <p>The problems we face today are too complex and too unpredictable to be solved in the comfort of a classroom. All innovators must learn to experiment: testing ideas in reality, carefully measuring what works, and gradually perfecting their thinking.</p>
                                                        <h6>4.   Making Decisions: </h6>
                                                        <p>Innovative thinking is meaningless without innovative execution. The essential competency is knowing when a decisive commitment is necessary and learning to continually spot our own weaknesses, biases, and blind spots before they come back to haunt us.</p>
                                                        <h6>5.   Learning from Mistakes</h6>
                                                        <p>Reality never turns out like we think it will. Even an exceptionally creative idea, rigorously tested, will produce different effects than we planned. Innovative thinkers learn to love these discrepancies. They use mistakes as opportunities to do better next time.</p>

                                                        <p>Students compete with one another according to their levels of engagement with the program, their understanding of the material, and their social influence. Competition spurs engagement without undermining the collaborative learning experience.</p>
                                                        <h6>5. Analytics</h6>
                                                        <p>Nomadic creates new data streams that allow instructors, administrators and students themselves to measure progress across dimensions like peer influence and intensity of engagement, in addition to standard measures of retention and understanding. Instructors can access real-time reports about the progress of students and the effectiveness of the program that are easy to interpret and simple to act upon. Analytics help tie learning more closely to the overall pedagogical goals of a particular class.

Data from multiple cohorts can be combined to give an overall picture of engagement in the program by all participants, and different cohorts can be compared to highlight group differences in engagement, understanding, and influence.</p>
                                                        <p>Clients can access real-time reports about the progress of learners and the effectiveness of the program that are easy to interpret and simple to share. These reports identify influencers and leaders and those who might require additional support. Detailed final reports help align learning with the strategic goals of the organization and demonstrate the ROI of the program—according to agreed upon performance benchmarks. </p>
